from itertools import permutations

#like what if this was 2314, the order of the list of permutations would differ, yes but read the question sir
#okay sure here u can put it in however u want, but if like, a random user were doing this and entered
#okay nvm i see ur point
#(laughing crying face emoji) oh my god pls be more okay

 #sort first ? why... it doesn't matter sort doesn't do that
#yes it does, bc it sorts in lexicographic order, the millionth one entails there's an order
#permutations lists the combinations in lexicographic order if you feed it in sorted
#if that makes sense ?
# print(list((permutations(string))))

a = permutations(range(10))
for i in range(10**6-1):
    next(a)
ans = next(a)
print(ans) # output = (2, 7, 8, 3, 9, 1, 5, 4, 6, 0)
a = ''
for i in ans:
    a += str(i)
print(a) # output = 2783915460 #dab



for i in range(10**6-1):
    #next(a)
    break

#sir why omg

b = permutations(range(10))
count = 0 # count is 0
for i in range(10**6-1):
    count += 1
eeep = list(b)
print(eeep[count])
print(str(eeep[count]))


# x = count
# answer = ''
# for i in range(len(a)):
#     answer += a[x]
#     x +=

#k thx i kno u r (laughing crying emoji
#HELLO !!!!!!
# don't judge me i'm trying to learn things ): i want to see all the permutations rn
# lit, sounds great, just use the toggle git tab?
# um
# I'm not judging u I'm tryingt to figure out how to get this linked to the repository well yeah but I had to make a folder and stuff
# hello
# sorry I'll just watch now

#run it, try running it
#wtf no!!!! i totally thought that up!!!!! while i was fucking
#washing the dishes
#you called the permutations iterable a
#that's why it's a
#right bc i didn't iterate thru all 10 places
#i have to now basically piggy back off of u at this point with
#the whole string idea
#i basically used c++ logic
#no but i can upload it to the repository, so can u right?
#fuck me.
#also you realize........ your loop..... does not do anything
# You just piggybacked on my code hoe yes you did, you didn't mak

#nvm it's like 3 million so idk why this iterator isn't working

#i'm getting an error for next(a)
#let me try as if it were c++
#can u undo what you just did lol How's that :)ju OH WE FORGOT 0!!! rip
# shit my bad lol go ahead

#does that not print out a million numbers ???
#OH and then i see i see ise e iseeeeee i just noticed the print statement out of the loop
#i hate how there are not braces to contain things in things
#c++ is much nicer to read

#q: is next(a) similar in idea to i++ if i = 0 before the loop?
# I don't know c++ lol
# next just calls next value of the iterator ;; gotcha i see
# also we low key cheated by using itertools but it's fine
# i lo key want to figure out the algorithm but also
#y;; what??? 10P10 ?
# I actually didn't mean to do that lolo
# Dude this fucking itertools thing is wack as shit
# what even is 10P10???
# 10 factorial
#no it calls the next method 999999 times and prints the millionth















#look sir
#i was just testing these functions lolol (crying laughing emoji)
